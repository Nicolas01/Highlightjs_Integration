This extension allows source code to be syntax highlighted on the wiki pages.
This README file might be out of date, have a look at the extension page
for updated informations:

    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Highlightjs_Integration

== Requirements ==

This version of the extension has been tested with highlight.js 11.5.1 and
MediaWiki 1.35.6.

== Installation ==

Add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

    wfLoadExtension( 'Highlightjs_Integration' );

This extension will use a bundled copy of highlight.js 11.5.1 with the common 
languages.
If you would like to use a different copy of the library, you can download it
on the highlight.js website and replace the
'extensions/MediaWiki/HighlightJS/highlight' folder.

=== Bug Uncaught SyntaxError: unterminated regular expression literal ===

The load of the highlight.min.js script in this extension raises a syntax 
error.
As a workaround, the highlight.min.js script is loaded from the CDNJS url 
instead of the file provided with this extension.

== Usage ==

On the wiki page, you can use "syntaxhighlight" or "source" elements:

<syntaxhighlight>
<?php
// some php code
</syntaxhighlight>

== Parameters ==

* lang;     Defines the language.
* inline;   The source code should be inline as part of a paragraph.

<syntaxhighlight lang="php">
<?php
// some php code
</syntaxhighlight>

<syntaxhighlight lang="cs" inline>var c = new Class();</syntaxhighlight>
